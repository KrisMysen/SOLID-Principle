Martin in the early 2000s.\r\n\r\nIt names five basic principles of object oriented design, with the intent to help programmers\r\ncreate systems that are easy to maintain and extend. \r\n\r\nThe principle <i>mnemonic acronym</i> stands for the following principles:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>S -> Single responsibility principle</li>\r\n\r\n<li>O -> Open/closed principle</li>\r\n\r\n<li>L -> Liskov substitution principle</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I -> Interface segregation principle</li>\r\n\r\n<li>D -> Dependency inversion principle</li>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n",
