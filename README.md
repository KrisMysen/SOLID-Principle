# SOLID-Principle
This project tries to shed some light onto the SOLID-Principle. It uses various code examples, to show bad and good implementations of each principle.

The SOLID-Principle is a mnemonic acronym introduced by Michael Feathers for the "first five principles" named by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s.

It names five basic principles of object oriented design, with the intent to help programmers create systems that are easy to maintain and extend.

The principle mnemonic acronym stands for the following principles:

<ul>
<li>S - Single responsibility principle</li>

<li>O - Open/closed principle</li>

<li>L - Liskov substitution principle</li>

<li>I - Interface segregation principle</li>

<li>D - Dependency inversion principle</li>
</ul>
